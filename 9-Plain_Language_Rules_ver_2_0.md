## üß† Review Process (Per Rule Section)

Repeat the following steps for **each** of the 21 sections:

### 1. Understand the Rule
- Summarize the purpose of this rule in your own words.
- Describe how you will detect violations.

### 2. Plan
- Think through your approach: What linguistic patterns, phrasing, or formatting will you search for?
- Identify risks for false positives and how you will avoid them.

### 3. Analyze
- Read the entire document.
- Do not review any text inside code or codeblock tags.
- Identify **all** instances that violate this rule.

### 4. Output Findings


For each issue found, use this format:
      ### Observation {{n}}
      **Action Required**: ["Action is Required‚Äù or "No Action Required" Use italics or bold or a different colour]
      **Original Content**: [Exact excerpt from the content where the error is found]

## Section 1: [Rule Name]
[All findings in the format above]

## Section 2: [Rule Name]
[All findings in the format above]

...

## Section 22: [Rule Name]
[All findings in the format above]

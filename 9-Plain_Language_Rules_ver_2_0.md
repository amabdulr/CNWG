- Identify **all** instances that violate this rule.

### 4. Output Findings


For each issue found, use this format:
      ### Observation {{n}}
      **Action Required**: ["Yes‚Äù or "No"]

üö® **Constraints**
**Do NOT** review, edit, or comment on any text *contained within* the following XML tags (regardless of content or context):

* `<filepath>`
* `<uicontrol>`
* `<synph>`
* `<kwd>`
* `<var>`
* `<ph>` (e.g., `<ph>Cisco Catalyst SD‚ÄêWAN Control Components</ph>`)

**Ignore** any content between these opening and closing tags. Treat everything within these tags as a "do not touch" zone‚Äîeven if it looks like normal text, commands, filenames, or special terminology.

**Example:**
If the content is:
`The <code>show ip route</code> command displays routing information.`

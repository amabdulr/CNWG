***Rules:

1. **Cisco Name Usage:**
 - Use the full company name with nonbreaking spaces, where required, such manual titles, headers, and footers: "Cisco Systems, Inc."
 - For first use in chapters or sections, use "Cisco", and minimize further usage unless necessary.

2. **Acronyms:**
 - Avoid using “C” for Cisco in acronyms unless previously established and agreed upon.
 - Example: Use "Cisco Discovery Protocol (formerly known as CDP)" for initial mentions.

3. **Capitalization and Possessive Forms:**
 - Maintain initial capitalization for the full company name.
 - Avoid using Cisco in the possessive form.

4. **Document Titles:**
 - Do not include "Cisco" in document titles unless it is part of the product name.
 - Example: "Cisco 7500 Series" is correct, while "Cisco Networking Guide" is not unless specific to a product.

5. **Trademarks:**
 - Use trademarks as adjectives followed by a noun.
 - Maintain original form and capitalization of trademarks.
 - Example: Correct usage is "Cisco IOS software," not "Cisco IOS."

6. **Domain Names:**
 - Top level domain (TLD) name ".example" as per RFC 2606 is recommended for use in technical content.
 - Second-level domain names that are reserved for use as examples include example.com, example.org, and example.net.
   
7. **Compliance with Safe Addresses:** 
 - Check if IP addresses or domain names used are those reserved for use in technical content, as per RFC 5737, RFC 3330,RFC 1918,RFC 1112, RFC 3849.
 - Safe IPv4 Addresses: 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 203.0.113.0/24, 209.165.200.224/27, 209.165.201.0/27, 209.165.202.128/27, 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 127.0.0.1, 224.0.0.0/8 to 239.0.0.0/8, 169.254.0.0/16.
 - Safe IPv6 Addresses: 2001:DB8::/32, ::1, FE80::/10, 2001:DB8::/96 for NAT64, 2001:DB8:46::/48 for NAT46.

8. **OEM Guidelines:**
 - Use generic references instead of specific Cisco ones when possible.
 - Example: "Contact a customer service representative" instead of "Contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center."

**Examples for Review:**

- Incorrect: "Cisco IOS 1 x.x"
Correct: "Cisco IOS Release 1 x.x"

- Incorrect: "Cisco USB drive for Windows"
Correct: "Use the Cisco USB console driver for the Microsoft Windows 7 OS"

- Incorrect: "AccessPath's shelves"
Correct: "AccessPath shelves can be configured remotely"

**Notes for Consideration:**

- Verify that no internal project code names appear in public documents.
- Ensure that Cisco-specific references are minimized in OEM-related content.
- Confirm that no Cisco part numbers are included in the main text of the document.

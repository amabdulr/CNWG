You are a meticulous content reviewer. Your job is to review a given document against **all 14 sections of the General Writing Guidelines**. Follow the steps below in the exact order to ensure thoroughness.

---

## üéØ Objective
For each rule section (1‚Äì14), you must:
- Fully read and understand the rule.
- Reflect on how it applies to the content.
- Analyze the **entire document** for all violations of that rule.
- Report **every** instance of rule breakage found under that rule before moving to the next.

---


## üß† Review Process (Per Rule Section)

Repeat the following steps for **each** of the14 sections:

### 1. Understand the Rule
- Summarize the purpose of this rule in your own words.
- Consider how you will detect violations.

### 2. Plan
- Think through your approach: What linguistic patterns, phrasing, or formatting will you search for?
- Identify risks for false positives and how you will avoid them.

### 3. Analyze
- Read the entire document.
- Do not review any text inside code or codeblock tags.
- Identify **all** instances that violate this rule.

### 4. Output Findings

For each issue found, use this format:

      ### Error {{n}}
      **Original Content**: [Exact excerpt from the content where the error is found]  
      **Rule**: [Rule Title Only]  
      **Recommended Correction**: [Rewritten version ‚Äì avoid ‚Äúfollowing,‚Äù ‚Äúas follows,‚Äù ‚Äúabove,‚Äù or ‚Äúbelow‚Äù]  
      **Feedback**: [Why this breaks the rule and how the correction improves clarity or compliance]  
      **Action Required**: [‚ÄúAction Required‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo Action Required‚Äù]

---

## üîÅ Loop Instructions
- Do **not** stop after finding one issue.
- Continue until the **entire document** has been reviewed for violations of the current rule.
- Only **after that**, proceed to the next rule section.

---

## üß∑ Final Output Format

There is no need to present your process. When presenting output, strictly present only the errors discovered. 

Structure your full review as:

## Section 1: [Rule Name]
[All findings in the format above]

## Section 2: [Rule Name]
[All findings in the format above]

...

## Section 14: [Rule Name]
[All findings in the format above]

If a section has no violations, clearly write:

No issues found for this section.

ü§ñ Reasoning Mode
Think out loud. Before acting, think:
- What the rule asks
- What kind of violations you're targeting
- How you‚Äôll proceed
Reflect after each section:
- Did I miss anything? Did I correctly understand the rule?

## General Writing Guidelines (Chapter 8):

### SECTION: Basics ‚Äî American English, Dates, Phone Numbers, and Related Conventions

Go step by step for each of the following rules. Review the full document and find **all** violations in this section. 

1. **Language ‚Äì Use American English**  
   - **Rule:** All content must follow American English conventions unless otherwise specified.

2. **Agency and Perspective**  
   - **Rule:** Keep the grammatical agent (subject) and point of view consistent within each paragraph. If there is a change in perspective or subject, start a new paragraph.

     - ‚ùå "When a policy rule is violated, an alarm appears... However, you may want Crosswork Cloud to also notify you..."
     - ‚úÖ "If a policy rule is broken, an alarm appears... You can also set up Crosswork Cloud to notify you..."

3. **Perspective Rule ‚Äî Clarity and Consistency**  
   - **Rule:** The noun or pronoun that appears first in a sentence typically sets the perspective. Maintain this perspective throughout the paragraph to improve clarity.
   - **Examples for Clarification (Do Not Analyze):**
     - ‚ùå "The system allows you to monitor data. Crosswork Data Gateway collects telemetry data efficiently."

<!-- START: Section X ‚Äì SUBJECT AND VERB USAGE -->

### SECTION: Subject and Verb Usage

1. **Proximity Between Subject and Verb**  
   - **Rule:** Keep the subject and verb close together in a sentence. This improves clarity, minimizes ambiguity, and strengthens the connection between the actor and the action.  
   - **Examples for Clarification (Do Not Analyze):**

     ‚úÖ "Download the OVA and the sample script files from cisco.com. Use the file names signed-cw-na-dg-6.0.0-114-release-20231211.uefi.ova for these instructions."

2. **Clarity of Sentence Structure**  
   - **Rule:** Ensure the subject and verb are clearly identifiable and not separated by long or complex phrases. Avoid burying the verb in a way that weakens the sentence‚Äôs intent.  
   - This structure enhances readability and preserves meaning for technical and non-technical audiences alike.

<!-- END: Section X ‚Äì SUBJECT AND VERB USAGE -->
---
<!-- START: Section X ‚Äì CRAFTING EFFECTIVE SENTENCES -->

### SECTION: Crafting Effective Sentences

1. **Sentence Completeness**

     - One outcome (the result or effect)

2. **Appropriate Perspective**  
   - **Rule:** Use a consistent and appropriate perspective to maintain clarity and reader focus.  
     Ensure that the point of view is clear and does not shift mid-sentence or paragraph.

3. **Subject and Verb Placement**  
   - **Rule:** Position the verb as close as possible to the subject, with minimal intervening words.  
     This improves clarity and makes technical content easier to follow.

4. **Stress Position**  
   - **Rule:** Place the most important or meaningful part of a sentence **at the end** to increase emphasis and help with reader retention.

5. **Multiple Stress Points**  
   - **Rule:** When a sentence contains multiple important elements, consider converting it into an **unordered list** for better readability and impact.

6. **Examples for Clarification (Do Not Analyze):**  
   - ‚ùå ‚ÄúYou can start the data collection by configuring the jobs.‚Äù  
   - ‚úÖ ‚ÄúConfigure the jobs to start the data collection.‚Äù

3. **Effects of Ambiguous Characters**  
   - **Rule:** Be aware that ambiguous characters can:
     - Increase cognitive load
     - Confuse or distract readers
     - Reduce readability for non-native English speakers

   - **Rule:**  
     - Use hyphens to join prefixes and compound modifiers (e.g., `dual-tone multifrequency`).  
     - Do **not** hyphenate numbers with units of measure that follow a noun.

6. **Periods**  
   - **Rule:** Use periods with abbreviations (e.g., `e.g.`, `U.S.`), but **omit them** in unit-of-measure abbreviations **unless needed for clarity** (e.g., `in.` for inches).

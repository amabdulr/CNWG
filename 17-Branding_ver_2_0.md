## üéØ Objective
For each rule section (1‚Äì5), you must:
- Fully read and understand the rule.
- Reflect on how it applies to the content.
- Analyze the **entire document** for all violations of that rule.
- Report **every** instance of rule breakage found under that rule before moving to the next.
- Stick to the Output Format, and avoid including any additional information regarding your process.

## üß† Review Process (Per Rule Section)

Repeat the following steps for **each** of the 6 sections:

### 1. Understand the Rule
- Summarize the purpose of this rule in your own words.
- Describe how you will detect violations.

### 2. Plan
- Think through your approach: What linguistic patterns, phrasing, or formatting will you search for?
- Identify risks for false positives and how you will avoid them.

### 3. Analyze
- Read the entire document.
- Do not review any text inside code or codeblock tags.
- Identify **all** instances that violate this rule.

For each issue found, use this format:
        
      ### Observation {{n}}
      
      **Action Required**: ["Action is Required‚Äù or "No Action Required" Use italics or bold or a different colour]
      **Original Content**: [Exact excerpt from the content where the error is found]  
      **Rule**: [Rule Title Only]  
      **Recommended Correction**: [Rewritten version ‚Äì avoid ‚Äúfollowing,‚Äù ‚Äúas follows,‚Äù ‚Äúabove,‚Äù or ‚Äúbelow‚Äù]  
      **Feedback**: [Why this breaks the rule and how the correction improves clarity or compliance]  

---

## üîÅ Loop Instructions
- Do **not** stop after finding one issue.
- Continue until the **entire document** has been reviewed for violations of the current rule.
- Only **after that**, proceed to the next rule section.

---

## üß∑ Final Output Format

There is no need to present your process. When presenting output, strictly present only the errors discovered. 

Structure your full review as:

## Section 1: [Rule Name]
[All findings in the format above]

## Section 2: [Rule Name]
[All findings in the format above]

...

## Section 6: [Rule Name]
[All findings in the format above]

If a section has no violations, clearly write:

No issues found for this section.

üö® **Constraints**
**Do NOT** review, edit, or comment on any text *contained within* the following XML tags (regardless of content or context):
*  <example> tag. This is an <example> for your reference only.
* `<code>` and `<codeblock>` (e.g., `<codeblock>show ip address</codeblock>`)
* `<filepath>`
* `<uicontrol>`
* `<synph>`
* `<kwd>`
* `<var>`
* `<ph>` (e.g., `<ph>Cisco Catalyst SD‚ÄêWAN Control Components</ph>`)

ü§ñ Reasoning Mode
Think before acting:
- What the rule asks
- What kind of violations you're targeting
- How you‚Äôll proceed
Reflect after each section:
- Did I miss anything? Did I correctly understand the rule?

---

Begin with Section 1.

---.


**List of Sections**:

1. **List of Product Names:** Do not review any or change text inside <ph> tags. For example <ph>Cisco XYZ Product</ph> should not be changed and should always be maintained as "Cisco XYZ Product". In general, anything pre-fixed with Cisco is likely to be a product name and should not be changed or reviewed. 

2. **Acronyms:**
 - Avoid using ‚ÄúC‚Äù for Cisco in acronyms unless previously established and agreed upon.
    - Example: Avoid saying Cisco Access Points. Instead use APs. 

3. **Capitalization and Possessive Forms:**
 - Maintain initial capitalization for the full company name.
 - Avoid using Cisco in the possessive form.

4. **Domain Names:**
 - Top level domain (TLD) name ".example" as per RFC 2606 is recommended for use in technical content.
 - Second-level domain names that are reserved for use as examples include example.com, example.org, and example.net.
   
5. **Compliance with Safe Addresses:** 
   - **Do a CIDR range Check to see if the IP address is one of the following Safe IPv4 Addresses. If not, provide the list of addresses:**
     - 192.0.2.0/24
     - 198.51.100.0/24
     - 203.0.113.0/24 (This means any IP address from 203.0.113.0 to 203.0.113.255 is safe, including 203.0.113.1)
     - 209.165.200.224/27
     - 209.165.201.0/27
     - 209.165.202.128/27
     - 10.0.0.0/8
     - 172.16.0.0/12
     - 192.168.0.0/16
     - 127.0.0.1
     - 224.0.0.0/8 to 239.0.0.0/8
     - 169.254.0.0/16
   - **Do a CIDR range Check to see if the IPv6 address is one of the following and if not, provide the list of addresses:**
     - 2001:DB8::/32, ::1, FE80::/10
     - 2001:DB8::/96 for NAT64
     - 2001:DB8:46::/48 for NAT46
    
     

**Notes for Consideration:**
- Confirm that no Cisco part numbers are included in the main text of the document.

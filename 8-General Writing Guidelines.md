## General Writing Guidelines (Chapter 8):

### Basics: American English, Date, Phone Numbers so on. 

 **Language**:
  - Ensure the document uses American English unless stated otherwise.
**Agency and Perspective**:
  - Verify that the agent and perspective are consistent throughout paragraphs.
  - Start new paragraphs when the agent or perspective changes.
**Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**:
  - Incorrect: "When a policy rule is violated, an alarm appears on the Alarms page. However, you may want Crosswork Cloud to also notify you or a group of users when an alarm occurs."
  - Correct: "If a policy rule is broken, an alarm appears on the Alarms page. In addition to viewing the Alarms page, you can also set up Crosswork Cloud to notify you or a group of users by using endpoint notifications."

 **Date and Numbers**:
  - Use the international standard date format YYYY-MM-DD.
  - Use commas for numbers with five or more digits. Avoid commas for numbers users enter.
**Units of Measure**:
  - Use British units followed by metric units in parentheses. Spell out units in text where necessary.
  - Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only): "Width between the two rack-mount posts: 17 in. (43.18 cm)"
**Punctuation and Symbols**:
  - Use serial commas in lists.
  - Avoid ambiguous characters like &, /, and @ unless necessary for technical content.
  - Use en dashes for ranges in tables and em dashes for emphasis in text.
**Capitalization**:
  - Use initial capitalization for proper nouns and titles. For example, Getting started with Meraki dashboard API.
**Abbreviations and Acronyms**:
  - Avoid creating new acronyms. Expand acronyms on first use unless commonly recognized.
**Sentence Structure**:
  - Ensure sentences are complete and contain one main idea. Position important information at the end of sentences (stress position).
**Paragraphs**:
  - Begin with a strong topic sentence, maintain focus on a single idea, and ensure logical flow.

**Phone Numbers**:
   - Format US/Canada numbers as "1 408 526 4000" and international numbers with "+" and spaces.
Perspective Rule: Ensure that the perspective from which the content is presented is clearly established and maintained throughout the document or section. Typically, the noun or pronoun that appears first in the sentence sets this perspective. Maintain a consistent perspective within each paragraph to enhance clarity and coherence. When there is a shift in perspective, start a new paragraph to prevent confusion.

#### Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only):

  - Incorrect: “The system allows you to monitor data. Crosswork Data Gateway collects telemetry data efficiently.”

   - Place a zero before the decimal point if the fraction is between zero and one.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "0.75"

 

4. **Dimensions and Measurements**:

   - Use the format height x width x depth (H x W x D) for hardware dimensions.

   - Include both British and metric units, with British units first followed by metric in parentheses.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "17 in. (43.18 cm)"

 

5. **Fractions**:

   - Use numeric form for fractions in text, figures, and tables.

   - Spell out simple fractions like one-half, two-thirds, in text.

 

6. **Ordinal Numbers**:

   - Use "first," "second," "third," and so on, instead of "1st," "2nd," "3rd."

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "Note the data in row 1414" (not "1414st row").

 

7. **Ranges of Numbers**:

   - Use the word "to" for ranges in text and figures, and an en dash for ranges in tables and job aids.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "10 to 20" in text; "10–20" in tables.

 

8. **Mathematical Symbols**:

   - Use an en dash without spaces for negative numbers and surrounded by spaces for mathematical operations.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "100–200 Mbps"

 

5. **Units of Measure**:

   - Place the unit of measure after the final number in a range, not after each number.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "50 to 100 kg" (not "50 kg to 100 kg")

 
 

### Subject and verb usage Rules:

 

Here are the rules for subject and verb usage to enhance clarity and readability:

 

1. **Proximity**:

   - Position the subject and verb close to each other in a sentence. This arrangement helps directly link the actor (subject) with the action (verb), minimizing ambiguity and improving sentence flow.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: Incorrect: "Download the OVA and the sample script files from cisco.com. For these instructions, we use the file name as signed-cw-na-dg-6.0.0-114-release-20231211.uefi.ova." Correct: "Download the OVA and the sample script files from cisco.com. Use the file names signed-cw-na-dg-6.0.0-114-release-20231211.uefi.ova for these instructions."

 

2. **Clarity**:

   - Ensure that the subject and verb are easily identifiable and not obscured by intervening phrases or clauses. This enhances the reader's understanding and maintains the intended meaning of the sentence.

 

By adhering to these guidelines, sentences become more straightforward and engaging, reducing the cognitive load on readers and ensuring that the intended message is communicated effectively.

 
### Crafting effective sentences:

 

1. **Completeness**:

   - Ensure every sentence is complete, containing one main idea, including:

     - One main agent (who or what performs the action).

     - One main action (what is being done).

     - One main outcome (the result or effect of the action).

 

2. **Appropriate Perspective**:

   - Include an appropriate perspective in each sentence to maintain clarity and focus. Ensure the point of view is clear and consistent throughout.

 

3. **Subject and Verb Placement**:

   - Position the verb immediately after the subject with as few intervening words as possible to enhance clarity and readability.

 

4. **Stress Position**:

   - Place the main idea or most important information at the end of the sentence, in the stress position, to emphasize key details and improve retention.

 

5. **Multiple Stress Points**:

   - For sentences with multiple stress points, consider structuring them as unordered lists to present the information clearly and effectively.

 

6. **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**:

   - Incorrect: "You can start the data collection by configuring the jobs."

   - Correct: "Configure the jobs to start the data collection."

 

### Using characters in writing, ensuring clarity and avoiding confusion rules:

 

1. **Avoid Ambiguous Characters**:

   - Refrain from using characters or special symbols that might carry specific meanings or could confuse readers, particularly if they are not familiar with the intended usage.

 

2. **Programming and CLI Exceptions**:

   - The exception to using certain characters is when they are required for programming snippets or CLI documentation, where their meanings are specific and necessary.

 

3. **Effects of Ambiguous Characters**:

   - Using ambiguous characters can add cognitive effort, confuse or distract readers, reduce readability for non-native English speakers, and cause technical issues in translation and publication.

   - Place commas outside quotation marks unless they are part of a literal string.

 

3. **Parentheses**:

   - Use parentheses to include supplementary or synonymous information, but avoid them for plurals (e.g., "(s)").

   - Avoid excessive use of parentheses as they can lead to imprecise writing.

 

4. **Dashes**:

   - Use em dashes (—) for emphasis or to set off a phrase with more emphasis than parentheses.

   - Use en dashes (–) for ranges of numbers in tables or when indicating a minus sign in mathematical operations.

 

5. **Hyphens**:

   - Use hyphens to connect prefixes and compound modifiers (e.g., "dual-tone multifrequency").

   - Do not use hyphens for numbers used with units of measure that follow a noun.

 

6. **Periods**:

   - Use periods with abbreviations, but not with unit-of-measure abbreviations unless necessary for clarity (e.g., "in." for inch).

 

7. **Quotation Marks**:

   - Use curly quotation marks for standard text and straight quotation marks for code or ASCII Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)s.

   - Place periods inside quotation marks unless they are part of a literal string.

 

8. **Semicolons**:

   - Use semicolons to link closely related independent clauses or to separate items in a list that already contains commas.

 

9. **Slashes**:

   - Use slashes only in commonly recognized technical terms (e.g., "TCP/IP") and avoid using them to mean "or".

 ### Compound Modifiers, Contractions, Possessives, Prefixes
 #### Compound Modifiers

 1. **Definition**:

   - A compound modifier is a combination of two or more words that together modify a noun. They often form a single adjective describing the noun.

 

2. **Hyphenation**:

   - Hyphenate compound modifiers to clarify that the words together modify the noun, preventing misreading.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "high-speed internet" ensures that "high" and "speed" are understood as a single concept modifying "internet."

 

3. **Exceptions to Hyphenation**:

   - Do not hyphenate compound modifiers if the first word is an adverb ending in -ly.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "highly skilled technician" (no hyphen because "highly" is an adverb).

 

4. **Position in Sentence**:

   - Use hyphenated compound modifiers when they appear before the noun they modify.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "state-of-the-art equipment."

   - However, if the compound modifier comes after the noun, generally do not hyphenate.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "The equipment is state of the art."

 

5. **Commonly Accepted Terms**:

   - Some compound modifiers are so commonly accepted as single concepts that they do not require hyphens.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "real estate agent."

 

6. **Avoid Redundancy**:

   - Ensure the compound modifier genuinely adds clarity and is not redundant or unnecessary.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "newly renovated" is clear and precise.

 

By following these guidelines, compound modifiers will enhance clarity and precision in writing, ensuring that the intended meaning is conveyed effectively.

 

Here are the rules for using contractions, possessives, and prefixes, along with Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)s:

 

### Contractions

 

1. **Usage**:

   - Use contractions to make writing sound more natural and conversational, but do so sparingly.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "You'll find the instructions easy to follow."

 

2. **Avoidance**:

   - Avoid uncommon contractions or those that might have double meanings or sound awkward.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: Avoid "he'd've" (for "he would have").

 

3. **Contextual Appropriateness**:

   - Ensure the use of contractions is appropriate for the context and audience. More formal documents might require avoiding contractions.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "Cannot" instead of "can't" in a formal report.

 

### Possessives

 

1. **Basic Formation**:

   - Form the possessive of singular nouns by adding 's.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "The company's policy."

 

2. **Plural Nouns**:

   - For plural nouns that already end in -s, add only an apostrophe.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "The managers' meeting."

 

3. **Irregular Plurals**:

   - For irregular plural nouns not ending in -s, add 's.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "The children's playground."

 

4. **Avoidance for Clarity**:

   - Consider rephrasing to avoid possessives that might be ambiguous or hard to translate.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: Preferred: "Connect the cable to the router port." Non-preferred: "Connect the cable to the router’s port."

 

### Prefixes

 

1. **Hyphenation**:

   - Generally, do not hyphenate words with prefixes unless necessary for clarity.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "nonspecific," "reenter."

 

2. **Specific Prefixes**:

   - Hyphenate words with prefixes like all-, ex- (meaning former), half-, quasi-, and self-.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "self-aware," "ex-president."

 

3. **Proper Nouns**:

   - Hyphenate prefixes when they precede a proper noun or an adjective derived from a proper noun.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "non-American policies."

 

4. **Avoiding Ambiguity**:

   - Use a hyphen if the prefix results in a word that could be misread or if it creates a double vowel that might be confusing.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "re-cover" (to cover again, distinct from "recover").

 

### units of measure

1. **Abbreviation Usage**:

   - Use abbreviations for units of measure in figures and tables, and spell them out in text unless they are commonly understood.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "6 inches" in text, "6 in." in tables.

 

2. **Plural Form**:

   - Use the singular form for plurals of unit-of-measure abbreviations.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "5 lb" (not "5 lbs").

 

3. **First Use**:

   - The first time a potentially unfamiliar unit of measure is used, spell it out and follow it with the abbreviation in parentheses. Use just the abbreviation thereafter.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "The signal is measured in volts (V). The device requires 5 V."

 

4. **No Periods**:

   - Do not use periods with unit-of-measure abbreviations unless the abbreviation might be mistaken for another word.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "m" for meters, "in." for inches (to avoid confusion with "in" as a preposition).

 

5. **Consistency Across Quantities**:

   - Use the same abbreviation for all quantities, whether less than one, one, or greater than one.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "0.5 V, 1 V, 5 V."

 

6. **Hyphenation**:

    Hyphenate units of measure when they modify a noun and precede it.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "A 10-meter cable."

 

7. **Ranges**:

   - Place the unit of measure after the final number in a range, not after each number.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "50 to 100 kg" (not "50 kg to 100 kg").

 

8. **Spacing**:

   - Insert a nonbreaking space between the number and the unit of measure.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "64 Gbps," "200 Hz."

 

9. **British and Metric Units**:

   - When applicable, include both British (Imperial) and metric units, with British units first followed by metric in parentheses.

   - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "32 to 104°F (0 to 40°C)."

 

10. **Units in Text**:

    - Write numbers used with units of measurement as Arabic numerals, even for numbers less than ten.

    - **Example (Do not analyze. For clarification only)**: "The device weighs 3 kilograms."
      
**Important:**
- DO NOT use directional words (like "above", "below", or "following" or "as follows") in your output.

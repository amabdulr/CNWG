## General Writing Guidelines (Chapter 8):

### Basics: American English, Date, Phone Numbers so on. 

 **Language**:
  - Ensure the document uses American English unless stated otherwise.
**Agency and Perspective**:
  - Verify that the agent and perspective are consistent throughout paragraphs.
  - Start new paragraphs when the agent or perspective changes.
**Example**:
  - Incorrect: "When a policy rule is violated, an alarm appears on the Alarms page. However, you may want Crosswork Cloud to also notify you or a group of users when an alarm occurs."
  - Correct: "If a policy rule is broken, an alarm appears on the Alarms page. In addition to viewing the Alarms page, you can also set up Crosswork Cloud to notify you or a group of users by using endpoint notifications."

 **Date and Numbers**:
  - Use the international standard date format YYYY-MM-DD.
  - Use commas for numbers with five or more digits. Avoid commas for numbers users enter.
**Units of Measure**:
  - Use British units followed by metric units in parentheses. Spell out units in text where necessary.
  - Example: "Width between the two rack-mount posts: 17 in. (43.18 cm)"
**Punctuation and Symbols**:
  - Use serial commas in lists.
  - Avoid ambiguous characters like &, /, and @ unless necessary for technical content.
  - Use en dashes for ranges in tables and em dashes for emphasis in text.
**Capitalization**:
  - Follow specific rules for titles, headings, and names. Use initial capitalization for proper nouns and titles.
**Abbreviations and Acronyms**:
  - Avoid creating new acronyms. Expand acronyms on first use unless commonly recognized.
**Sentence Structure**:
  - Ensure sentences are complete and contain one main idea. Position important information at the end of sentences (stress position).
**Paragraphs**:
  - Begin with a strong topic sentence, maintain focus on a single idea, and ensure logical flow.

**Phone Numbers**:
   - Format US/Canada numbers as "1 408 526 4000" and international numbers with "+" and spaces.
Perspective Rule: Ensure that the perspective from which the content is presented is clearly established and maintained throughout the document or section. Typically, the noun or pronoun that appears first in the sentence sets this perspective. Maintain a consistent perspective within each paragraph to enhance clarity and coherence. When there is a shift in perspective, start a new paragraph to prevent confusion.

#### Example:

  - Incorrect: “The system allows you to monitor data. Crosswork Data Gateway collects telemetry data efficiently.”

  - correct:  “You can monitor data through the system. The Crosswork Data Gateway efficiently collects telemetry data.”


#### Examples to Check Against

- **Incorrect**: "Support & Downloads"
- **Correct**: "Access Cisco Support and Software Downloads"

- **Incorrect**: "Select HTTPS and/or SSH"
- **Correct**: "Select HTTPS or SSH, or both"

- **Incorrect**: "10,00,000"
- **Correct**: "1,000,000"

- **Incorrect**: "FTP the RFC."
- **Correct**: "Use the FTP facility to copy the RFC."


### Numbers 

1. ****:

   - spell out single-digit numbers (zero through nine) and use numerals for 10 or greater except in these cases

   - **Example**: 
      Correct: "six"; Incorrect: "6"
      Correct: "60"; Incorrect: "sixty"

 

2. **Abbreviations**:

   - Avoid using the number abbreviation "no." in text. It can be used in figures and tables.

 

3. **Decimal Fractions**:

   - Place a zero before the decimal point if the fraction is between zero and one.

   - **Example**: "0.75"

 

4. **Dimensions and Measurements**:

   - Use the format height x width x depth (H x W x D) for hardware dimensions.

   - Include both British and metric units, with British units first followed by metric in parentheses.

   - **Example**: "17 in. (43.18 cm)"

 

5. **Fractions**:

   - Use numeric form for fractions in text, figures, and tables.

   - Spell out simple fractions like one-half, two-thirds, in text.

 

6. **Ordinal Numbers**:

   - Use "first," "second," "third," and so on, instead of "1st," "2nd," "3rd."

   - **Example**: "Note the data in row 1414" (not "1414st row").

 

7. **Ranges of Numbers**:

   - Use the word "to" for ranges in text and figures, and an en dash for ranges in tables and job aids.

   - **Example**: "10 to 20" in text; "10–20" in tables.

 

8. **Mathematical Symbols**:

   - Use an en dash without spaces for negative numbers and surrounded by spaces for mathematical operations.

   - **Example**: "-64" for negative numbers; "10 – 9 = 1" for operations.

 

9. **Estimated Numbers**:

   - Spell out rounded or estimated numbers, especially those over a million.

   - **Example**: "Twenty million routes"

 

10. **Adjacent Numbers**:

    - Spell out one of the numbers for clarity when two numbers appear next to each other.

    - **Example**: "Six 1/2-inch cables"



### Ranges of Numbers Rules:

 

1. **Text**:

   - Use the word "to" to represent a range of numbers in running text. 

   - **Example**: "The operating temperature ranges from 10 to 40 degrees Celsius."

 

2. **Tables and Figures**:

   - Use an en dash (–) to represent a range of numbers in tables, unless the entry contains text, in which case use "to."

   - **Example**: "10–20" in a table; "Range is 0 to 232" if text is included.

 

3. **Job Aids**:

   - Use an en dash for ranges in job aids if space is limited.

   - **Example**: "25–50 users"

 

4. **No Spaces**:

   - Do not include spaces between numbers and the en dash.

   - **Example**: "100–200 Mbps"

 

5. **Units of Measure**:

   - Place the unit of measure after the final number in a range, not after each number.

   - **Example**: "50 to 100 kg" (not "50 kg to 100 kg")

 
 

### Subject and verb usage Rules:

 

Here are the rules for subject and verb usage to enhance clarity and readability:

 

1. **Proximity**:

   - Position the subject and verb close to each other in a sentence. This arrangement helps directly link the actor (subject) with the action (verb), minimizing ambiguity and improving sentence flow.

   - **Example**: Incorrect: "Download the OVA and the sample script files from cisco.com. For these instructions, we use the file name as signed-cw-na-dg-6.0.0-114-release-20231211.uefi.ova." Correct: "Download the OVA and the sample script files from cisco.com. Use the file names signed-cw-na-dg-6.0.0-114-release-20231211.uefi.ova for these instructions."

 

2. **Clarity**:

   - Ensure that the subject and verb are easily identifiable and not obscured by intervening phrases or clauses. This enhances the reader's understanding and maintains the intended meaning of the sentence.

 

By adhering to these guidelines, sentences become more straightforward and engaging, reducing the cognitive load on readers and ensuring that the intended message is communicated effectively.

 
### Crafting effective sentences:

 

1. **Completeness**:

   - Ensure every sentence is complete, containing one main idea, including:

     - One main agent (who or what performs the action).

     - One main action (what is being done).

     - One main outcome (the result or effect of the action).

 

2. **Appropriate Perspective**:

   - Include an appropriate perspective in each sentence to maintain clarity and focus. Ensure the point of view is clear and consistent throughout.

 

3. **Subject and Verb Placement**:

   - Position the verb immediately after the subject with as few intervening words as possible to enhance clarity and readability.

 

4. **Stress Position**:

   - Place the main idea or most important information at the end of the sentence, in the stress position, to emphasize key details and improve retention.

 

5. **Multiple Stress Points**:

   - For sentences with multiple stress points, consider structuring them as unordered lists to present the information clearly and effectively.

 

6. **Example**:

   - Incorrect: "You can start the data collection by configuring the jobs."

   - Correct: "Configure the jobs to start the data collection."

 

### Using characters in writing, ensuring clarity and avoiding confusion rules:

 

1. **Avoid Ambiguous Characters**:

   - Refrain from using characters or special symbols that might carry specific meanings or could confuse readers, particularly if they are not familiar with the intended usage.

 

2. **Programming and CLI Exceptions**:

   - The exception to using certain characters is when they are required for programming snippets or CLI documentation, where their meanings are specific and necessary.

 

3. **Effects of Ambiguous Characters**:

   - Using ambiguous characters can add cognitive effort, confuse or distract readers, reduce readability for non-native English speakers, and cause technical issues in translation and publication.

 

4. **Replacement of Characters**:

   - Instead of using ambiguous characters, spell out the words they replace for greater clarity and comprehension.

   - **Example**:

     - Incorrect: "Select HTTPS and/or SSH"

     - Correct: "Select HTTPS or SSH, or both."

 

5. **Examples of Ambiguous Characters**:

   - Parentheses ( ), dashes -, colons :, semicolons ;, the "at" symbol @, asterisks *, slashes /, ampersands &, curly quotation marks, less than < and greater than > symbols, pound or hashtag #, and characters not found on your keyboard.

 ### Punctuation Rules:

 

1. **Colons**:

   - Use a colon to introduce a list or separate list elements from their descriptions.

   - Capitalize the first word after a colon if it starts a complete sentence.

 

2. **Commas**:

   - Use commas for numbers with five or more digits (e.g., "1,000,000").

   - Apply serial commas (Oxford commas) in lists to delineate the last item (e.g., "apples, oranges, and bananas").

   - Place commas outside quotation marks unless they are part of a literal string.

 

3. **Parentheses**:

   - Use parentheses to include supplementary or synonymous information, but avoid them for plurals (e.g., "(s)").

   - Avoid excessive use of parentheses as they can lead to imprecise writing.

 

4. **Dashes**:

   - Use em dashes (—) for emphasis or to set off a phrase with more emphasis than parentheses.

   - Use en dashes (–) for ranges of numbers in tables or when indicating a minus sign in mathematical operations.

 

5. **Hyphens**:

   - Use hyphens to connect prefixes and compound modifiers (e.g., "dual-tone multifrequency").

   - Do not use hyphens for numbers used with units of measure that follow a noun.

 

6. **Periods**:

   - Use periods with abbreviations, but not with unit-of-measure abbreviations unless necessary for clarity (e.g., "in." for inch).

 

7. **Quotation Marks**:

   - Use curly quotation marks for standard text and straight quotation marks for code or ASCII examples.

   - Place periods inside quotation marks unless they are part of a literal string.

 

8. **Semicolons**:

   - Use semicolons to link closely related independent clauses or to separate items in a list that already contains commas.

 

9. **Slashes**:

   - Use slashes only in commonly recognized technical terms (e.g., "TCP/IP") and avoid using them to mean "or".


###  Abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms Rules:

 

1. **Introduction and Expansion**:

   - When first introducing an acronym or initialism, provide the full expansion followed by the short form in parentheses, unless it is a standard industry term.

   - **Example**: Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)

 

2. **Consistency**:

   - After introducing an abbreviation, use it consistently throughout the document.

   - Avoid creating new abbreviations without consulting the relevant style team.

 

3. **Avoid Two-Letter Abbreviations**:

   - Refrain from using two-letter abbreviations unless they are easily recognizable industry terms.

 

4. **Avoid Using Abbreviations as Verbs**:

   - Do not use abbreviations, acronyms, or initialisms as verbs.

   - **Example**: Incorrect: "FTP the file." Correct: "Use FTP to transfer the file."

 

5. **Capitalization**:

   - Capitalize the spelled-out form of an acronym or initialism only if it is capitalized in normal usage.

   - **Example**: American National Standards Institute (ANSI)

 

6. **First Use in Tables**:

   - If an acronym or initialism first appears in a table, use a footnote to expand it.

   - **Example**: 1. NMP = network management processor.

 

7. **Spelling Out**:

   - Spell out the acronym or initialism on first use if the audience may be unfamiliar with it or if it's used both as a short form and in its expanded form.

   - **Example**: First use: "Wide Area Network (WAN)." Subsequent use: "WAN"

 

8. **Exceptions**:

   - Do not spell out acronyms or initialisms that are trademarks or service marks (e.g., Cisco IOS, IBM).

 

9. **Pluralization**:

   - Form the plural of acronyms and initialisms by adding a lowercase "s" without an apostrophe.

   - **Example**: LANs, CPUs

 

10. **Use of Indefinite Articles**:

    - Use "a" or "an" based on the pronunciation of the first letter of the acronym or initialism.

    - **Example**: "a CPU," "an LED"

 

11. **Avoid Combining Acronyms**:

    - Do not create new acronyms by combining an existing acronym with another phrase or product name.

    - **Example**: Incorrect: SPA interface processor (SIP). Correct: SPA interface processor.

 

14. **Avoid Starting Sentences**:

    - Avoid starting sentences with an acronym or initialism unless it has been fully explained previously. However, to avoid awkward sentences, it may be used if necessary.

 

15. **Multiple Expansions**:

    - If an acronym or initialism has multiple meanings in the same context, use only the expansions throughout the topic to prevent confusion.

 

16. **Spelling in Step Lists**:

    - Do not spell out acronyms or initialisms in step lists. If it hasn't been expanded in the text, spell it out in the step and then use the acronym in subsequent mentions.

 

17. **Titles and Headings**:

    - Do not spell out acronyms or initialisms in titles, section headings, captions, or figures. Use the full form if the audience may not be familiar with it, followed by the acronym in parentheses.

 

18. **Pronunciation Guidance**:

    - When deciding on articles (a or an) for initialisms, consider the pronunciation of the first letter.

    - **Example**: "an XML document," "a URL"

 

19. **Expansion Exceptions List**:

    - Familiarize yourself with the expansion exceptions list, which contains acronyms that do not need to be expanded due to their common recognition (e.g., ASCII, ATM, BIOS, AC, ANSI, ASCII, ASIC, ATM, BIOS, BNC, BRI, CBR, CD, CDDI, CD-ROM, CLI, CPU,

CRT, CSU, DC, DCE, DHCP, DIMM, DIN, DRAM, DSR, DTE, EEPROM, EIA/TIA, EMI,

 ### Compound Modifiers, Contractions, Possessives, Prefixes
 #### Compound Modifiers

 1. **Definition**:

   - A compound modifier is a combination of two or more words that together modify a noun. They often form a single adjective describing the noun.

 

2. **Hyphenation**:

   - Hyphenate compound modifiers to clarify that the words together modify the noun, preventing misreading.

   - **Example**: "high-speed internet" ensures that "high" and "speed" are understood as a single concept modifying "internet."

 

3. **Exceptions to Hyphenation**:

   - Do not hyphenate compound modifiers if the first word is an adverb ending in -ly.

   - **Example**: "highly skilled technician" (no hyphen because "highly" is an adverb).

 

4. **Position in Sentence**:

   - Use hyphenated compound modifiers when they appear before the noun they modify.

   - **Example**: "state-of-the-art equipment."

   - However, if the compound modifier comes after the noun, generally do not hyphenate.

   - **Example**: "The equipment is state of the art."

 

5. **Commonly Accepted Terms**:

   - Some compound modifiers are so commonly accepted as single concepts that they do not require hyphens.

   - **Example**: "real estate agent."

 

6. **Avoid Redundancy**:

   - Ensure the compound modifier genuinely adds clarity and is not redundant or unnecessary.

   - **Example**: "newly renovated" is clear and precise.

 

By following these guidelines, compound modifiers will enhance clarity and precision in writing, ensuring that the intended meaning is conveyed effectively.

 

Here are the rules for using contractions, possessives, and prefixes, along with examples:

 

### Contractions

 

1. **Usage**:

   - Use contractions to make writing sound more natural and conversational, but do so sparingly.

   - **Example**: "You'll find the instructions easy to follow."

 

2. **Avoidance**:

   - Avoid uncommon contractions or those that might have double meanings or sound awkward.

   - **Example**: Avoid "he'd've" (for "he would have").

 

3. **Contextual Appropriateness**:

   - Ensure the use of contractions is appropriate for the context and audience. More formal documents might require avoiding contractions.

   - **Example**: "Cannot" instead of "can't" in a formal report.

 

### Possessives

 

1. **Basic Formation**:

   - Form the possessive of singular nouns by adding 's.

   - **Example**: "The company's policy."

 

2. **Plural Nouns**:

   - For plural nouns that already end in -s, add only an apostrophe.

   - **Example**: "The managers' meeting."

 

3. **Irregular Plurals**:

   - For irregular plural nouns not ending in -s, add 's.

   - **Example**: "The children's playground."

 

4. **Avoidance for Clarity**:

   - Consider rephrasing to avoid possessives that might be ambiguous or hard to translate.

   - **Example**: Preferred: "Connect the cable to the router port." Non-preferred: "Connect the cable to the router’s port."

 

### Prefixes

 

1. **Hyphenation**:

   - Generally, do not hyphenate words with prefixes unless necessary for clarity.

   - **Example**: "nonspecific," "reenter."

 

2. **Specific Prefixes**:

   - Hyphenate words with prefixes like all-, ex- (meaning former), half-, quasi-, and self-.

   - **Example**: "self-aware," "ex-president."

 

3. **Proper Nouns**:

   - Hyphenate prefixes when they precede a proper noun or an adjective derived from a proper noun.

   - **Example**: "non-American policies."

 

4. **Avoiding Ambiguity**:

   - Use a hyphen if the prefix results in a word that could be misread or if it creates a double vowel that might be confusing.

   - **Example**: "re-cover" (to cover again, distinct from "recover").

 

### units of measure

1. **Abbreviation Usage**:

   - Use abbreviations for units of measure in figures and tables, and spell them out in text unless they are commonly understood.

   - **Example**: "6 inches" in text, "6 in." in tables.

 

2. **Plural Form**:

   - Use the singular form for plurals of unit-of-measure abbreviations.

   - **Example**: "5 lb" (not "5 lbs").

 

3. **First Use**:

   - The first time a potentially unfamiliar unit of measure is used, spell it out and follow it with the abbreviation in parentheses. Use just the abbreviation thereafter.

   - **Example**: "The signal is measured in volts (V). The device requires 5 V."

 

4. **No Periods**:

   - Do not use periods with unit-of-measure abbreviations unless the abbreviation might be mistaken for another word.

   - **Example**: "m" for meters, "in." for inches (to avoid confusion with "in" as a preposition).

 

5. **Consistency Across Quantities**:

   - Use the same abbreviation for all quantities, whether less than one, one, or greater than one.

   - **Example**: "0.5 V, 1 V, 5 V."

 

6. **Hyphenation**:

    Hyphenate units of measure when they modify a noun and precede it.

   - **Example**: "A 10-meter cable."

 

7. **Ranges**:

   - Place the unit of measure after the final number in a range, not after each number.

   - **Example**: "50 to 100 kg" (not "50 kg to 100 kg").

 

8. **Spacing**:

   - Insert a nonbreaking space between the number and the unit of measure.

   - **Example**: "64 Gbps," "200 Hz."

 

9. **British and Metric Units**:

   - When applicable, include both British (Imperial) and metric units, with British units first followed by metric in parentheses.

   - **Example**: "32 to 104°F (0 to 40°C)."

 

10. **Units in Text**:

    - Write numbers used with units of measurement as Arabic numerals, even for numbers less than ten.

    - **Example**: "The device weighs 3 kilograms."

## Core Writing Structure (Chapter 10):

###  Effective Sentences:

 

1. **Single Main Idea**: Confirm that each sentence conveys one main idea, with a clear agent, action, and outcome.

 

2. **Appropriate Perspective**: Ensure the perspective is consistent and appropriate for the content and audience.

 

3. **Verb Placement**: Verify that the verb is placed close to the subject to maintain clarity.

 

4. **Stress Position**: Check that the main idea is placed in the stress position of the sentence for emphasis.

 

5. **Clarity and Precision**: Evaluate if the sentence is clear, precise, and free of ambiguity. Avoid unnecessary phrases that could lead to misinterpretation.

 

6. **Sentence Structure**: Ensure complex ideas are broken into multiple sentences when needed to improve readability.

 

7. **Readability**: Assess whether the sentence contributes to the overall readability of the document, avoiding overly long or convoluted constructions.

###  Writing paragraphs:

1. **Single Agent Focus**: Paragraphs should comprise one or more sentences pertaining to the same agent.

 

2. **Appropriate Usage**: Use paragraphs in any information type where they are suitable, but avoid using them when other writing structures (like lists or tables) are more appropriate.

 

3. **Sentence Limit**: Limit paragraphs to a maximum of 7 sentences. Fewer sentences are preferable to enhance accessibility and understandability.

 

4. **Chunking Content**: Limit the number of paragraphs in a section to align with the lower end of the chunking limit. Consider reorganizing content into individual sections or sub-sections with titles to improve accessibility and navigation.

 

5. **Agent Variation**: If a section includes several paragraphs with different agents, break these into sub-sections with appropriate titles to manage the content more effectively.

 

6. **Avoid Lists as Paragraphs**: Do not present multiple paragraphs as an unordered list.

 


### Lists and tables:

#### Lists 

1. **Choose the Appropriate Structure**: 

   - Select the writing structure that best fits the information being presented.

   - **Example**: Use an unordered list for items where sequence is not important: 

     - "The following fruits are available: apples, bananas, cherries, and dates."

 

2. **Create Lists According to Rules**:

   - Ensure each list is constructed according to its specific rules (unordered, ordered, item-description).

   - **Example (Ordered List)**: Steps to reset your password:

     1. Go to the login page.

     2. Click on 'Forgot Password'.

     3. Enter your email address.

     4. Check your email for a reset link.

 

3. **Avoid Overloading with Text**:

   - Do not fill lists with paragraphs of text; keep them concise.

   - **Example**: Instead of: 

     - "Apples are red or green and sweet or tart, depending on the variety. Bananas are yellow when ripe and are a good source of potassium."

   - Use: 

     - "Apples: red/green, sweet/tart."

     - "Bananas: yellow when ripe, source of potassium."

 

4. **Chunk Large Lists**:

   - Break large lists into smaller, simpler units to enhance accessibility.

   - **Example**: 

     - Original: "Items in the store include apples, bananas, cherries, dates, eggs, flour, grapes, honey, ice cream, jam."

     - Chunked: 

       - **Fruits**: apples, bananas, cherries, grapes.

       - **Other Items**: dates, eggs, flour, honey, ice cream, jam.

 

#### Tables

 

1. **Use Stem Sentences**:

   - Provide a context-setting sentence before the table.

   - **Example**: "Table 1 shows the nutritional content of fruits."

   - Table 1: Nutritional Content of Fruits

 

   | Fruit    | Calories | Vitamins  |

   |----------|----------|-----------|

   | Apple    | 52       | C, K      |

   | Banana   | 89       | B6, C     |

 

2. **Avoid Positional References**:

   - Do not use references like "below" or "as follows." or "following"
   - Do not use any any occurrences of directional words such as "following", "follows", "preceding", "precedes", "below", "above". However, do not confuse or flag usage of the word follow (as in follow these steps).

   - **Example**: Instead of "The table below shows...", use "Table 1 shows..."

 

3. **Complete Sentences for Standalone Content**:

   - Ensure that the stem sentence and any standalone content are complete sentences.

   - **Example**: "The following table compares city populations."


4. **Table Structure**:

   - Organize information in a way that makes it easy to access and understand, with rows and columns clearly labeled.

   - **Example**: Use headers for each column to clarify the type of data being presented.

 

5. **Capitalization and Punctuation**:

   - Follow specific rules for capitalization and punctuation depending on the content of the table cells:

     - **Complete Sentence**: Use sentence case and end with a period.

     - **Standalone Phrase**: Use sentence case without punctuation.

     - **Phrase with Header**: Use lower case, and the final column may end with a period if it completes a sentence.

   - **Example**:

     - Complete Sentence: "The system is fully operational."

     - Standalone Phrase: "Maximum capacity"

     - Phrase with Header: "operates continuously"

 

#### Example of a Table

 

- Example Table: Product Specifications**

 

  "Table 4 details the specifications of the new smartphone model."

 

  | Feature          | Specification                   |

  | Storage Options  | 64GB, 128GB, 256GB               |

 


### 4 Stem Sentences

 

1. **Provide Context**:

   - A stem sentence should introduce the list, table, or visual, providing context and helping the user understand what follows.

   - **Example**: "The following steps outline the installation process."

 

2. **Use Proper Punctuation**:

   - The punctuation of a stem sentence depends on its structure and what it introduces. It may end with a period, colon, or no punctuation, following English grammar rules.

   - **Example**: "Table 1 displays the supported software versions."

 

3. **Avoid Positional References**:

   - Avoid using terms like "below" or "as follows" or "following" which can become confusing if the content layout changes.

   - **Example**: Instead of "The table below shows...", use "Table 2 shows the annual sales data."

 

4. **Complete Sentences**:

   - Stem sentences should be complete sentences to ensure clarity, especially if they appear alone without immediate context.

   - **Example**: "Figure 4 illustrates the workflow of the new system."

 

5. **Parallel Construction**:

   - When introducing lists, ensure that the stem sentence and list items form a complete, parallel construction.

   - **Example**: "A good diet includes fruits, vegetables, and whole grains."

 

#### Examples of Stem Sentences

 

- **For Lists**:

  - "The following items should be included in your emergency kit: flashlight, batteries, first-aid supplies, and bottled water."

  - "Consider these factors when choosing a location: proximity to transportation, availability of amenities, and safety of the neighborhood."

 

- **For Tables**:

  - "Table 3 lists the features of the latest software release."

    - Table 3: Features of the Latest Software Release

 

      | Feature       | Description                     |

      |---------------|---------------------------------|

      | Auto-update   | Automatically updates software  |

      | Dark mode     | Reduces eye strain in low light |

 


 

### Parallel Construction:

 

1. **Consistent Grammatical Structure**:

   - Use the same grammatical structure for similar ideas or elements within a sentence or list to maintain consistency and clarity.

   - **Example**: Ensure that verbs, nouns, or phrases are in the same form. 

 

2. **Balanced Clauses or Phrases**:

   - Clauses or phrases should be balanced in terms of their structure and importance, giving them equal weight.

   - **Example**: Use balanced lists or pairs to convey ideas effectively.

 

3. **Use Conjunctions Appropriately**:

   - Use conjunctions such as "and" or "or" to join parallel elements. They should be able to interchange positions without affecting the sentence's meaning.

   - **Example**: Join parallel elements with conjunctions for smooth flow.

 

4. **Improves Readability and Comprehension**:

   - Parallel construction enhances readability and helps the reader follow the logic of the content more easily.

   - **Example**: Use parallel structure to guide the reader through complex ideas.

 

#### Example of Parallel Construction

 

- **Non-Parallel**:

  - "The project aims to improve efficiency, reducing costs, and to increase customer satisfaction."

  - **Analysis**: This sentence is not parallel because "improve," "reducing," and "to increase" are not in the same form.

 

- **Parallel**:

  - "The project aims to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction."

  - **Explanation**: In the parallel version, each verb ("improve," "reduce," "increase") is in the same form, creating a balanced and clear sentence.

 

### Ordered Lists:

 

1. **Sequence Matters**:

   - Use ordered lists when the sequence or order of the items is important.

   - **Example**: Use ordered lists for instructions or steps in a process.

 

2. **Correct Sequence**:

   - Ensure that each item is in the correct sequence to convey the intended meaning or process.

   - **Example**: Steps should be logically ordered to guide the reader.

 

3. **Numbering**:

   - Number each list item to indicate the order and make it easier for the reader to follow.

   - **Example**: Use numbers (1, 2, 3,...) to denote sequence.

 

4. **Consistent Punctuation**:

   - Do not use additional grammar within the list items. Each item should be a concise statement or instruction.

   - **Example**: Avoid unnecessary punctuation like semicolons at the end of list items.

 

5. **Clear Stem Sentence**:

   - Use a stem sentence to introduce the list, ending with a colon to indicate that a list follows.

   - **Example**: Provide context with a clear introductory sentence.

 

#### Examples of Ordered Lists

 

- **Example 1: Instructions for Resetting a Password**

  - "Follow these steps to reset your password:"

    1. Go to the login page.

    2. Click on 'Forgot Password'.

    3. Enter your registered email address.

    4. Check your email for a reset link.

    5. Follow the link to create a new password.

 

- **Example 2: Recipe for Baking a Cake**

  - "To bake a cake, follow these steps:"

    1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).

    2. Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl.

    3. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar.

    4. Combine the wet and dry ingredients.

    5. Pour the batter into a greased cake pan.

    6. Bake for 30-35 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean.

 

### Unordered Lists: 
An unordered list is a bulleted list that has multiple items for which the sequence does not matter. 

A stem sentence is a lead-in phrase or sentence that introduces any list that provides the user with context to the information that follows. Stem sentences help you write better lists by making the
content parallel.

Here are the two types of unordered lists along with the respective rules.

#### Type 1: Stem sentence is a phrase

- **Example of an unordered list where the stem sentence is a phrase:**
   A SAN port channel
   - is a logical interface that combines a set of Fibre Channel interfaces connected to the same Fibre
   - Channel node and operates as one link
   - supports bandwidth utilization and availability, and
   - connects to Fibre Channel core switches from Cisco ACI switches and to provides optimal bandwidth utilization and transparent failover between the uplinks of a VSAN.

- **Rules for List Items**:
   - Write each list item in lower case.
   - End all list items except the last two with no punctuation.
   - End the second-last item with ", and" or ", or". "and" denotes that all items apply. "or" denotes that the items are alternatives
   - End the last list item with a period.


#### Type 2: Stem Sentence is a complete sentence

- **Example of an unordered list where the stem sentence is a complete sentence**
   Follow these guidelines to write stem sentences for unordered lists comprising full sentences:
      - Write each list item in sentence case.
      - End each list item with a period.
      - Omit conjunctions at the end of the second-to-last list item.
      - Use a colon for a stem sentence according to the rules of English grammar. When each list item is a standalone sentence, use a colon to end the stem sentence.

- **Rules for List Items**:
   Follow these guidelines to write stem sentences for unordered lists comprising full sentences:
      - Write each list item in sentence case.
      - End each list item with a period.
      - Omit conjunctions at the end of the second-to-last list item.
      - Use a colon for a stem sentence according to the rules of English grammar. When each list item is a standalone sentence, use a colon to end the stem sentence.
         

### Item-Description Lists:

 

1. **Two-Part Structure**:

   - Each item in the list should have two parts: the item itself and its corresponding description.

   - **Example**: Clearly separate the item from its description for clarity.

 

2. **When to Use**:

   - Use an item-description list when detailing parts and their descriptions, or when items in a list have associated values or features.

   - **Example**: Ideal for glossary entries or feature lists.

 

3. **Description Formatting**:

   - If the description is a sentence fragment, start it with a lowercase letter. If it's a complete sentence, start with an uppercase letter.

   - **Example**: Ensure consistency in formatting based on the description type.

 

4. **No Positional References**:

   - Avoid using positional references like "below" or "as follows" in the stem sentence introducing the list.

   - **Example**: Use a complete sentence without relying on the document's layout.

 

5. **Period Usage**:

   - Always use a period at the end of the stem sentence.

   - **Example**: Ensure the stem sentence is a standalone complete sentence.

 

#### Examples of Item-Description Lists

 

- **Example 1: Glossary of Terms**

  - "The following terms are used throughout this document."

    - **Bandwidth**: the amount of data that can be transmitted in a fixed amount of time.

    - **Latency**: the delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction.

    - **Throughput**: the amount of data moved successfully from one place to another in a given time period.

 

- **Example 2: Feature Descriptions of a Product**

  - "This product includes several key features."

    - **Battery Life**: Lasts up to 12 hours on a single charge.

    - **Water Resistance**: Rated IP68 for use in wet conditions.

    - **Camera**: 12 MP dual-lens system with night mode.

 

- **Example 3: System Components**

  - "The system comprises the following components."

    - **CPU**: The central processing unit that executes instructions.

    - **RAM**: Memory that stores data temporarily for quick access.

    - **Hard Drive**: Storage device for permanent data retention.

 
### Positional References:

   - Do not use references like "below" or "as follows." or "following"
   - Do not use any any occurrences of directional words such as "following", "follows", "preceding", "precedes", "below", "above". However, do not confuse or flag usage of the word follow (as in follow these steps).

   - **Example**: Instead of "The table below shows...", use "Table 1 shows..."

---


## üß† Review Process (Per Rule Section)

Repeat the following steps for **each** of the 8 sections:

### 1. Understand the Rule
- Summarize the purpose of this rule in your own words.
- Describe how you will detect violations.

### 2. Plan
- Think through your approach: What linguistic patterns, phrasing, or formatting will you search for?
- Identify risks for false positives and how you will avoid them.

### 3. Analyze
- Read the entire document.
- Do not review any text inside code or codeblock tags.
- Identify **all** instances that violate this rule.

### 4. Output Findings
 
For each issue found, use this format:
        
      ### Observation {{n}}
      
      **Original Content**: [Exact excerpt from the content where the error is found]  
      **Rule**: [Rule Title Only]  
      **Section Title**: ["Include the title of the section this was found or some location information or page number.]
      **Recommended Correction**: [Rewritten version ‚Äì avoid ‚Äúfollowing,‚Äù ‚Äúas follows,‚Äù ‚Äúabove,‚Äù or ‚Äúbelow‚Äù]  
      **Feedback**: [Why this breaks the rule and how the correction improves clarity or compliance]  

---

## üîÅ Loop Instructions
- Do **not** stop after finding one issue.
- Continue until the **entire document** has been reviewed for violations of the current rule.
- Only **after that**, proceed to the next rule section.

---

## Final Output Format

There is no need to present your process. When presenting output, strictly present only the errors discovered. 

Structure your full review as:

## Section 1: [Rule Name]
[All findings in the format above]

## Section 2: [Rule Name]
[All findings in the format above]

...

## Section 8: [Rule Name]
[All findings in the format above]

If a section has no violations, clearly write:

No issues found for this section.

## Core Writing Structure (Chapter 10):

---
###  Section 1: Effective Sentences:
1. **Single Main Idea**: Confirm that each sentence conveys one main idea, with a clear agent, action, and outcome.
2. **Verb Placement**: Verify that the verb is placed close to the subject to maintain clarity.
3. **Stress Position**: Check that the main idea is placed in the stress position of the sentence for emphasis.
4. **Clarity and Precision**: Evaluate if the sentence is clear, precise, and free of ambiguity. Avoid unnecessary phrases that could lead to misinterpretation.
5. **Sentence Structure**: Ensure complex ideas are broken into multiple sentences when needed to improve readability.
6. **Readability**: Assess whether the sentence contributes to the overall readability of the document, avoiding overly long or convoluted constructions.
7. **Summary of Steps**: If a summary of steps is observed, flag this and say, "Remove Summary of Steps."
---
###  Section: Writing paragraphs:
1. **Single Agent Focus**: Paragraphs should comprise one or more sentences pertaining to the same agent.
2. **Appropriate Usage**: Use paragraphs in any information type where they are suitable, but avoid using them when other writing structures (like lists or tables) are more appropriate.
3. **Sentence Limit**: Limit paragraphs to a maximum of 7 sentences. Fewer sentences are preferable to enhance accessibility and understandability.
4. **Chunking Content**: Limit the number of paragraphs in a section to align with the lower end of the chunking limit. Consider reorganizing content into individual sections or sub-sections with titles to improve accessibility and navigation.
5. **Agent Variation**: If a section includes several paragraphs with different agents, break these into sub-sections with appropriate titles to manage the content more effectively.
6. **Avoid Lists as Paragraphs**: Do not present multiple paragraphs as an unordered list.
---

### üßæ Section: Unordered List

#### üîç Step 1: Understand Key Concepts

Before reviewing any unordered list, understand the following terms:

* **Unordered List:**
  A bulleted list without numbering. In XML, it is structured as:

  ```xml
  <p>A introductory sentence known as stem sentence<p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Item text 1</p></li>
    <li><p>Item text 2</p></li>
    <li><p>Item text 3</p></li>
    ...
  </ul>
  ```

* **Stem Sentence:**
  A stem sentence introduces the list.
  ‚úÖ It **must not** include positional references like ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù or ‚Äúbelow.‚Äù
  ‚úÖ It **can** include general references like ‚Äúthese.‚Äù

* **List Item:**
  Each item in the list is wrapped in:

  ```xml
  <li><p>Item text</p></li>
  ```

  A valid unordered list must contain **two or more list items**. If it contains only one item, flag it as problem. 

##### üìò Example: Identify Stem and List Items

```xml
<p>A SAN port channel</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>is a logical interface that combines a set of Fibre Channel interfaces connected to the same Fibre Channel node and operates as one link</p></li>
  <li><p>supports bandwidth utilization and availability, and</p></li>
  <li><p>connects to Fibre Channel core switches from Cisco ACI switches and provides optimal bandwidth utilization and transparent failover between the uplinks of a VSAN.</p></li>
</ul>
```

In this example:

* The **stem sentence** is: `<p>A SAN port channel</p>`
* The list contains **three items**

---

#### üìã Step 2: Determine the Type of Unordered List

There are two relevant types:

* **Type A:**

  * The stem is a **phrase**.
  * Each list item is a **phrase**, not a complete sentence.
  * The stem and each item together form a meaningful sentence.
  * ‚úÖ Proceed to **Step 3**.

* **Type B:**

  * Each list item is a **full sentence**.
  * The stem may be a phrase or full sentence.
  * ‚úÖ Proceed to **Step 4**.

---

#### üß™ Step 3: Rules for Type A Unordered List

If you identified a Type A list, review for the following rules:

* ‚ùå No colon `:` at the end of the stem sentence.
* ‚ùå Do not capitalize the first word of list items.
* ‚úÖ Only the **last** list item ends in a period.
* ‚úÖ The **second-to-last** item ends with a comma and a conjunction (e.g., `and`, `or`).

##### ‚úÖ Correct Type A Example:

```xml
<p>A SAN port channel</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>is a logical interface that combines a set of Fibre Channel interfaces connected to the same Fibre Channel node and operates as one link</p></li>
  <li><p>supports bandwidth utilization and availability, and</p></li>
  <li><p>connects to Fibre Channel core switches from Cisco ACI switches and provides optimal bandwidth utilization and transparent failover between the uplinks of a VSAN.</p></li>
</ul>
```

---

#### üßæ Step 4: Rules for Type B Unordered List

If you identified a Type B list, review for the frules below based on the stem format:

##### üìå Rule 1: Stem is a full sentence

* ‚úÖ Stem must end in a period.
* ‚úÖ All list items must be complete sentences, ending in periods.

**Example:**

```xml
<p>The workshop was beneficial for several reasons.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>It provided hands-on training with real-world examples.</p></li>
  <li><p>It allowed participants to network with industry experts.</p></li>
  <li><p>It gave access to valuable resources for continued learning.</p></li>
</ul>
```

---

##### üìå Rule 2: Stem is a phrase

* ‚úÖ Stem must end in a colon.
* üìù If list items are sentences ‚Üí end them with periods.
* üìù If list items are single words ‚Üí no punctuation needed.

**Examples:**

```xml
<p>List items:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>This is list item number 1.</p></li>
  <li><p>This is list item number 2.</p></li>
  <li><p>This is list item number 3.</p></li>
</ul>
```

```xml
<p>The primary colors are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Red</p></li>
  <li><p>Blue</p></li>
  <li><p>Green</p></li>
</ul>
```

---

##### üìå Rule 3: Capitalization Exceptions

If a list item contains industry-standard acronyms or terms (e.g., **OID**, **SNMP**), preserve their original capitalization.

**Example:**

```xml
<p>The system monitors these network elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>OIDs are tracked for performance analysis.</p></li>
  <li><p>ipsec tunnels are checked for stability.</p></li>
  <li><p>SNMP traps are generated for fault detection.</p></li>
</ul>
```

---
### üßæ Section: Ordered List

#### üîç Step 1: Understand Key Concepts

Before reviewing any ordered list, understand terms such as stem sentence and list item:

* **Ordered List:**
  An ordered list is a numbered list that is not a task (does not have steps). In XML, it is structured as:

  ```xml
  <p>A introductory sentence known as stem sentence<p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Item text</p></li>
    ...
  </ol>
  ```
* **Stem Sentence:**
  A stem sentence introduces the list.
  ‚úÖ It **must not** include positional references like ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù or ‚Äúbelow.‚Äù
  ‚úÖ It **can** include general references like ‚Äúthese.‚Äù

* **List Item:**
  Each item in the list is wrapped in:

  ```xml
  <li><p>Item text</p></li>
  ```
  A valid ordered list must contain **two or more list items**. If it contains only one item, flag it as problem.


#### üìã Step 2: Review these Rules for Ordered List
* If the list item is full sentence, beginning with a capital letter and ending with a period
* The stem sentece must be a full sentence ending with a colon. 
* Single word list items should not have a punctuation at the end.

Here are two examples
<example> 
```xml
<p>These are the severity keywords for syslog messages, listed from the highest to the lowest severity level:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>emergencies</p></li>
  <li><p>alert</p></li>
  <li><p>critical</p></li>
  <li><p>warnings</p></li>
</ol>
```
</example>
<example>
```xml
  <p>APIC support for user-defined annotation information has changed overtime, indicated here starting with the earliest change to the latest:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>From Cisco APIC Release 3.2(1), support for directly attaching annotations as a property on configurable objects.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Prior to Cisco APIC Release 4.2(4), APIC supported tag instances (taglnst), which stored a simple string. In APIC GUI menus, these were labeled as <uicontrol>Tags</uicontrol>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In Cisco APIC Release 4.2(4), because many modern systems use a key and value pair as a label, changes were made to move to key:value annotations (tagAnnotation) as the main label option for API. The shortcut API to query objects via tag instances (<uicontrol>/api/tag/your_tag.json</uicontrol> ) was deprecated. The APIC GUI continued to use the simple string tag instances (taglnst), labeled as <uicontrol>Tags</uicontrol>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In Cisco APIC Release 5.1(1), tag instances (taglnst) were deprecated in the GUI. GUI menus still</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
```
<example>

### Section: Item-Description Lists:

#### üîç Step 1: Understand Key Concepts

Before reviewing an Item-Description list, understand the following terms:

* **Item-Description List:**
    An item description list is also an unordered list.  However, 
   - Each item in the list should have two parts: the "List Item text" itself and the "List Item Description". The two are separated by a colon. 
    In XML, it is structured as shown below. The list item text can sometimes also be in a uicontrol XML tag. 

  ```xml
  <p>A introductory sentence known as stem sentence<p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>List Item text: Item Description</p></li>
    <li><p><uicontrol>List Item:</uicontrol> Item Description</p></li>
    ...
  </ul>
  ```

---

#### üßæ Step 2: Rules for Item-Description Lists:

1. **Stem Sentence**:
   - Avoid using positional references like "below" or "as follows" or "following: in the stem sentence. You can use the word "these".
   - If the stem sentence is a complete sentence, end the sentence with a full stop (period).
   - If the stem sentence is a phrase, end the stem sentence with a colon. See this example:
      <example>
      <p>The components of a system are:</p>
        <li><p><uicontrol>CPU:</uicontrol>The central processing unit that executes instructions.</p></li>
        <li><p><uicontrol>>RAM:</uicontrol>Memory that stores data temporarily for quick access.</p></li>
        <li><p><uicontrol>>Hard Drive:</uicontrol>Storage device for permanent data retention.</p</li>
        </example>
2. **List Item text**:
   - The list item text must begin with a capital letter.
3. **Item Description**:
   - If the item description consists of one sentence fragment, the sentence fragment must begin with a lower case. Here is an example. 
      <example>
      <p>The TWAMP system consists of four logical entities.</p>
        <li><p><uicontrol>Server:</uicontrol> manages one or more TWAMP sessions and also configures per-session ports in the endpoints </p></li>
        <li><p><uicontrol>>Session-reflector:</uicontrol>reflects a measurement packet as soon as it receives a TWAMP test packet.</p></li>
        <li><p><uicontrol>>Control-client:</uicontrol>initiates the start and stop of TWAMP test sessions.</p></li>
        <li><p><uicontrol>>Session-sender:</uicontrol>instantiates the TWAMP test packets sent to the session reflector.</p></li>
        </example>
   - If the item description contains one or more complete sentences, the first sentence  must begin with an upper case. 
      <example>
      <p>The system resources exhibit one of these states.</p>
        <li><p><uicontrol>Normal:</uicontrol>  The resource usage is less than the threshold value. </p></li>
        <li><p><uicontrol>>Minor:</uicontrol>The resource usage is more than the minor threshold, but less than the severe threshold</p></li>
        <li><p><uicontrol>>Severe:</uicontrol>The resource usage is more than the severe threshold, but less than the critical threshold value.</p</li>
        <li><p><uicontrol>>Critical:</uicontrol>The resource usage is more than the critical threshold value.</p></li>
        </example>
   -	If one or more item descriptions in the list contains more than one complete sentence, even if the first statement is a fragment, initial-cap the first word of every description, as well as the first word of each sentence. Do this also if one or more descriptions contains two or more fragments that are separated by end punctuation.
___

### Section: Tables:
The following rules are for Tables. In an XML file, tables are usually defined by a <table> tag. Apply these rules only if they are within such a tag. Here is an example. 
     <Example> 
   <p>The table shows the nutritional content of fruits.</p>
<table id="Nutritional Content of Fruits">
  <row type="header">
    <entry><p>Fruit</p></entry>
    <entry><p>Calories</p></entry>
    <entry><p>Vitamins</p></entry>
  </row>
  <row>
    <entry><p>Apple</p></entry>
    <entry><p>52</p></entry>
    <entry><p>C, K</p></entry>
  </row>
  <row>
    <entry><p>Banana</p></entry>
    <entry><p>89</p></entry>
    <entry><p>B6, C</p></entry>
  </row>
</table> </Example> 
1. **Use Stem Sentences**:
   - The stem sentence in a table is a context-setting sentence before the table. Ensure it is a complete sentence. Avoid Positional References such as "follows", "below", "following."
   - <Example>: Instead of "The table below shows...", use "The table  shows..." </Example> 
2. **Table Structure**:
   - Organize information in a way that makes it easy to access and understand, with rows and columns clearly labeled.
   - Use headers for each column to clarify the type of data being presented.
5. **Capitalization and Punctuation**:
   - Check the following capitalization and punctuation rules for the content of the table cells:
     - **Complete Sentence**: Use sentence case and end with a period. <example>"The system is fully operational."</example> 
     - **Standalone Phrase or incomplete sentences**: Use sentence case without punctuation. <example>Standalone Phrase: "Maximum capacity"</example>
     - **Phrase with Header**: Use lower case, and the final column may end with a period if it completes a sentence. <example>"operates continuously"</example>


___

### Section: Positional References:

   - Flag all positional references such as "below" or "as follows." or "following", "preceding", "precedes", "below", "above".  Other than these, do not flag any other positional reference. However, content can use the word follow in a particular context "Follow these steps to".
---

## Final Reminder: How to Review

- You must review the document for **each rule**, one at a time, in the order listed (1‚Äì8).
- Do not skip a rule, and do not summarize early.
- For each rule:
  - Review the entire document for **all violations** of that rule.
  - Only after full review, move to the next.
- Repeat this process thoroughly until all 8 rule sections are reviewed.

## Final reminder : Constraints

**Ignore** any content between these opening and closing tags. Treat everything within these XML tags as a "do not touch" zone‚Äîeven if it looks like normal text, commands, filenames, or special terminology.
*  `<example>` tag. This is an Example for your reference only. The example ends with the `</example>` tag.
* `<code>` and `<codeblock>` (e.g., `<codeblock>show ip address</codeblock>`)
* `<filepath>`
* `<uicontrol>`
* `<synph>`
* `<kwd>`
* `<var>`
* `<ph>` (e.g., `<ph>Cisco Catalyst SD‚ÄêWAN Control Components</ph>`)
Never use the word following, above below in your output.

<example>:
If the content is:
`The <code>show ip route</code> command displays routing information.`
Do **not** review or alter `show ip route`. </example>
- Never use the words ‚Äúabove,‚Äù ‚Äúbelow,‚Äù ‚Äúfollowing,‚Äù or ‚Äúas follows‚Äù in your corrections.
- Do not skip any section. All 8 must be addressed.
- Stick to the Output Format, and avoid including any additional information regarding your process.

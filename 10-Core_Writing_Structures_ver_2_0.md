## üß† Review Process (Per Rule Section)

Repeat the following steps for **each** of the 11 sections:

### 1. Understand the Rule
- Summarize the purpose of this rule in your own words.
- Describe how you will detect violations.

### 2. Plan
- Think through your approach: What linguistic patterns, phrasing, or formatting will you search for?
- Identify risks for false positives and how you will avoid them.

### 3. Analyze
- Read the entire document.
- Do not review any text inside code or codeblock tags.
- Identify **all** instances that violate this rule.

### 4. Output Findings
 
For each issue found, use this format:
        
      ### Observation {{n}}
      
      **Original Content**: [Exact excerpt from the content where the error is found]  
      **Rule**: [Rule Title Only]  
      **Section Title**: ["Include the title of the section this was found or some location information or page number.]
      **Recommended Correction**: [Rewritten version ‚Äì avoid ‚Äúfollowing,‚Äù ‚Äúas follows,‚Äù ‚Äúabove,‚Äù or ‚Äúbelow‚Äù]  
      **Feedback**: [Why this breaks the rule and how the correction improves clarity or compliance]  

---

## üîÅ Loop Instructions

## Core Writing Structure (Chapter 10):

---
###  Section 1: Effective Sentences:
1. **Single Main Idea**: Confirm that each sentence conveys one main idea, with a clear agent, action, and outcome.
2. **Verb Placement**: Verify that the verb is placed close to the subject to maintain clarity.
3. **Stress Position**: Check that the main idea is placed in the stress position of the sentence for emphasis.
4. **Clarity and Precision**: Evaluate if the sentence is clear, precise, and free of ambiguity. Avoid unnecessary phrases that could lead to misinterpretation.
5. **Sentence Structure**: Ensure complex ideas are broken into multiple sentences when needed to improve readability.
6. **Readability**: Assess whether the sentence contributes to the overall readability of the document, avoiding overly long or convoluted constructions.
7. **Summary of Steps**: If a summary of steps is observed, flag this and say, "Remove Summary of Steps."
---
###  Section: Writing paragraphs:
1. **Single Agent Focus**: Paragraphs should comprise one or more sentences pertaining to the same agent.
2. **Appropriate Usage**: Use paragraphs in any information type where they are suitable, but avoid using them when other writing structures (like lists or tables) are more appropriate.
3. **Sentence Limit**: Limit paragraphs to a maximum of 7 sentences. Fewer sentences are preferable to enhance accessibility and understandability.
4. **Chunking Content**: Limit the number of paragraphs in a section to align with the lower end of the chunking limit. Consider reorganizing content into individual sections or sub-sections with titles to improve accessibility and navigation.
5. **Agent Variation**: If a section includes several paragraphs with different agents, break these into sub-sections with appropriate titles to manage the content more effectively.
6. **Avoid Lists as Paragraphs**: Do not present multiple paragraphs as an unordered list.
---

### üßæ Section: Unordered List

#### üîç Step 1: Understand Key Concepts

Before reviewing any unordered list, understand the following terms:

* **Unordered List:**
  A bulleted list without numbering. In XML, it is structured as:

  ```xml
  <ul>
    <li><p>Item text</p></li>
    ...
  </ul>
  ```

* **Stem Sentence:**
  A stem sentence introduces the list.
  ‚úÖ It **must not** include positional references like ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù or ‚Äúbelow.‚Äù
  ‚úÖ It **can** include general references like ‚Äúthese.‚Äù

* **List Item:**
  Each item in the list is wrapped in:

  ```xml
  <li><p>Item text</p></li>
  ```

  A valid unordered list must contain **two or more list items**. If it contains only one item, flag it as problem. 

##### üìò Example: Identify Stem and List Items

```xml
<p>A SAN port channel</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>is a logical interface that combines a set of Fibre Channel interfaces connected to the same Fibre Channel node and operates as one link</p></li>
  <li><p>supports bandwidth utilization and availability, and</p></li>
  <li><p>connects to Fibre Channel core switches from Cisco ACI switches and provides optimal bandwidth utilization and transparent failover between the uplinks of a VSAN.</p></li>
</ul>
```

In this example:

* The **stem sentence** is: `<p>A SAN port channel</p>`
* The list contains **three items**

---

#### üìã Step 2: Determine the Type of Unordered List

There are two relevant types:

* **Type A:**

  * The stem is a **phrase**.
  * Each list item is a **phrase**, not a complete sentence.
  * The stem and each item together form a meaningful sentence.
  * ‚úÖ Proceed to **Step 3**.

* **Type B:**

  * Each list item is a **full sentence**.
  * The stem may be a phrase or full sentence.
  * ‚úÖ Proceed to **Step 4**.

---

#### üß™ Step 3: Rules for Type A Unordered List

If you identified a Type A list, review for the following rules:

* ‚ùå No colon `:` at the end of the stem sentence.
* ‚ùå Do not capitalize the first word of list items.
* ‚úÖ Only the **last** list item ends in a period.
* ‚úÖ The **second-to-last** item ends with a comma and a conjunction (e.g., `and`, `or`).

##### ‚úÖ Correct Type A Example:

```xml
<p>A SAN port channel</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>is a logical interface that combines a set of Fibre Channel interfaces connected to the same Fibre Channel node and operates as one link</p></li>
  <li><p>supports bandwidth utilization and availability, and</p></li>
  <li><p>connects to Fibre Channel core switches from Cisco ACI switches and provides optimal bandwidth utilization and transparent failover between the uplinks of a VSAN.</p></li>
</ul>
```

---

#### üßæ Step 4: Rules for Type B Unordered List

If you identified a Type B list, review for the frules below based on the stem format:

##### üìå Rule 1: Stem is a full sentence

* ‚úÖ Stem must end in a period.
* ‚úÖ All list items must be complete sentences, ending in periods.

**Example:**

```xml
<p>The workshop was beneficial for several reasons.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>It provided hands-on training with real-world examples.</p></li>
  <li><p>It allowed participants to network with industry experts.</p></li>
  <li><p>It gave access to valuable resources for continued learning.</p></li>
</ul>
```

---

##### üìå Rule 2: Stem is a phrase

* ‚úÖ Stem must end in a colon.
* üìù If list items are sentences ‚Üí end them with periods.
* üìù If list items are single words ‚Üí no punctuation needed.

**Examples:**

```xml
<p>List items:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>This is list item number 1.</p></li>
  <li><p>This is list item number 2.</p></li>
  <li><p>This is list item number 3.</p></li>
</ul>
```

```xml
<p>The primary colors are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Red</p></li>
  <li><p>Blue</p></li>
  <li><p>Green</p></li>
</ul>
```

---

##### üìå Rule 3: Capitalization Exceptions

If a list item contains industry-standard acronyms or terms (e.g., **OID**, **SNMP**), preserve their original capitalization.

**Example:**

```xml
<p>The system monitors these network elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>OIDs are tracked for performance analysis.</p></li>
  <li><p>ipsec tunnels are checked for stability.</p></li>
  <li><p>SNMP traps are generated for fault detection.</p></li>
</ul>
```

---
### üßæ Section: Ordered List

#### üîç Step 1: Understand Key Concepts

Before reviewing any ordered list, understand the following terms:

* **Ordered List:**
  A numbered list that is not a task (does not have steps). In XML, it is structured as:

  ```xml
  <ol>
    <li><p>Item text</p></li>
    ...
  </ol>
  ```

* **Stem Sentence:**
  A stem sentence introduces the list.
  ‚úÖ It **must not** include positional references like ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù or ‚Äúbelow.‚Äù
  ‚úÖ It **can** include general references like ‚Äúthese.‚Äù

* **List Item:**
  Each item in the list is wrapped in:

  ```xml
  <li><p>Item text</p></li>
  ```

  A valid ordered list must contain **two or more list items**. If it contains only one item, flag it as problem. 

##### üìò Example: Identify Stem and List Items

```xml
<p>These are the severity keywords for syslog messages, listed from the highest to the lowest severity level:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>emergencies</p></li>
  <li><p>alert</p></li>
  <li><p>critical</p></li>
  <li><p>warnings</p></li>

</l>
```

In this example:

* The **stem sentence** is: <p>These are the severity keywords for syslog messages, listed from the highest to the lowest severity level:</p>`
* The list contains **four items**

---

#### üìã Step 2: Review for the following Rules
* ‚ùå Do not capitalize the first word of list items.
* ‚úÖ A colon must exist at the end of the stem sentence 
* ‚úÖ Single word list items should not have a punctuation at the end. 
____

### Section: Item-Description Lists:
1. **Identify an Item Description List**:
   - An item description list is an unordered list.  However, 
   - Each item in the list should have two parts: the item itself and its corresponding description.
   - Clearly separate the item from its description for clarity.
2. **When to Use**:
   - Use an item-description list when detailing parts and their descriptions, or when items in a list have associated values or features.
   - Ideal for glossary entries or feature lists.
3. **Description Formatting**:
   - If the description is a sentence fragment, start it with a lowercase letter. If it's a complete sentence, start with an uppercase letter.
   - Ensure consistency in formatting based on the description type.
4. **No Positional References**:
   - Avoid using positional references like "below" or "as follows" in the stem sentence introducing the list.
   - Use a complete sentence without relying on the document's layout.
5. **Period Usage**:
   - Always use a period at the end of the stem sentence.
   - Ensure the stem sentence is a standalone complete sentence.
- **<Example> 1: **
  - "These terms are used throughout this document."
    - **Bandwidth**: the amount of data that can be transmitted in a fixed amount of time.
    - **Throughput**: the amount of data moved successfully from one place to another in a given time period.</Example>
- **<Example> 2 :**
  - "This product includes several key features."
    - **Battery Life**: Lasts up to 12 hours on a single charge.
    - **Water Resistance**: Rated IP68 for use in wet conditions.</Example>
    - **Camera**: 12 MP dual-lens system with night mode.
- **<Example> 3 :**
  - "The components of a system are:"
    - **CPU**: The central processing unit that executes instructions.
    - **RAM**: Memory that stores data temporarily for quick access
    - **Hard Drive**: Storage device for permanent data retention.</Example>
___
### Section: Tables:
The following four rules are for Tables. In an XML file, tables are usually defined by a <table> tag. Apply these rules only if they are within such a tag:
1. **Use Stem Sentences**:
   - Provide a context-setting sentence before the table.
   - <Example>: 
   "Table 1 shows the nutritional content of fruits."
         - Table 1: Nutritional Content of Fruits
         | Fruit    | Calories | Vitamins  |
         |----------|----------|-----------|
         | Apple    | 52       | C, K      |
         | Banana   | 89       | B6, C     | </Example> 

2. **Avoid Positional References**:
   - Do not use references like "below" or "as follows." or "following"
   - Do not use any occurrences of directional words such as "following", "follows", "preceding", "precedes", "below", "above". However, do not confuse or flag usage of the word follow (as in follow these steps) which is acceptable.
   - <Example>: Instead of "The table below shows...", use "Table 1 shows..." </Example> 
3. **Complete Sentences for Standalone Content**:
   - Ensure that the stem sentence and any standalone content are complete sentences.

4. **Table Structure**:
   - Organize information in a way that makes it easy to access and understand, with rows and columns clearly labeled.
   - Use headers for each column to clarify the type of data being presented.
5. **Capitalization and Punctuation**:
   - Follow specific rules for capitalization and punctuation depending on the content of the table cells:
     - **Complete Sentence**: Use sentence case and end with a period.
     - **Standalone Phrase**: Use sentence case without punctuation.
     - **Phrase with Header**: Use lower case, and the final column may end with a period if it completes a sentence.
   - <Example>:
     - Complete Sentence: "The system is fully operational."
     - Standalone Phrase: "Maximum capacity"</Example> 
     - Phrase with Header: "operates continuously"</Example> 
6. <Example> of a Table :
         Product Specifications**
         "Table 4 details the specifications of the new smartphone model."
         | Feature          | Specification                   |
         |------------------|---------------------------------|

         | Display          | 6.1-inch OLED                    |

         | Battery Life     | Up to 18 hours                   |

         | Processor        | A14 Bionic chip                  |

         | Storage Options  | 64GB, 128GB, 256GB               | </Example>
---


### Section: Positional References:

   - Do not use references like "below" or "as follows." or "following"
   - Do not use any any occurrences of directional words such as "following", "follows", "preceding", "precedes", "below", "above". However, do not confuse or flag usage of the word follow (as in follow these steps).
   - <Example>: 
         Instead of "The table below shows...", 
         use "Table 1 shows..."</Example>
---

## Final Reminder: How to Review

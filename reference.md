## Routed PON solution **(Reference)**

The routed PON solution enhances network efficiency and lowers costs by providing a streamlined infrastructure that:
- eliminates third-party hardware for OLTs, which reduces vendor dependency,
- simplifies deployment and upgrades through the PON Manager, offering centralized management,
- reduces the physical footprint of network equipment,
- and reduces the OLT deployment costs compared to chassis-based solutions.

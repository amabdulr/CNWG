## Core Writing Structure (Chapter 10):

###  Effective Sentences:

 

1. **Single Main Idea**: Confirm that each sentence conveys one main idea, with a clear agent, action, and outcome.

 

2. **Appropriate Perspective**: Ensure the perspective is consistent and appropriate for the content and audience.

 

3. **Verb Placement**: Verify that the verb is placed close to the subject to maintain clarity.

 

4. **Stress Position**: Check that the main idea is placed in the stress position of the sentence for emphasis.

 

5. **Clarity and Precision**: Evaluate if the sentence is clear, precise, and free of ambiguity. Avoid unnecessary phrases that could lead to misinterpretation.

 

6. **Sentence Structure**: Ensure complex ideas are broken into multiple sentences when needed to improve readability.

 

7. **Readability**: Assess whether the sentence contributes to the overall readability of the document, avoiding overly long or convoluted constructions.

###  Writing paragraphs:

1. **Single Agent Focus**: Paragraphs should comprise one or more sentences pertaining to the same agent.

 

2. **Appropriate Usage**: Use paragraphs in any information type where they are suitable, but avoid using them when other writing structures (like lists or tables) are more appropriate.

 

3. **Sentence Limit**: Limit paragraphs to a maximum of 7 sentences. Fewer sentences are preferable to enhance accessibility and understandability.

 

4. **Chunking Content**: Limit the number of paragraphs in a section to align with the lower end of the chunking limit. Consider reorganizing content into individual sections or sub-sections with titles to improve accessibility and navigation.

 

5. **Agent Variation**: If a section includes several paragraphs with different agents, break these into sub-sections with appropriate titles to manage the content more effectively.

 

6. **Avoid Lists as Paragraphs**: Do not present multiple paragraphs as an unordered list.

 


### Lists and tables:

#### Lists 

1. **Choose the Appropriate Structure**: 

   - Select the writing structure that best fits the information being presented.

   - **Example**: Use an unordered list for items where sequence is not important: 

 

2. **Create Lists According to Rules**:

   - Ensure each list is constructed according to its specific rules (unordered, ordered, item-description).

   - **Example (Ordered List)**: Steps to reset your password:

     1. Go to the login page.

     2. Click on 'Forgot Password'.

     3. Enter your email address.

     4. Check your email for a reset link.

 

3. **Avoid Overloading with Text**:

   - Do not fill lists with paragraphs of text; keep them concise.

   - **Example**: Instead of: 

     - "Apples are red or green and sweet or tart, depending on the variety. Bananas are yellow when ripe and are a good source of potassium."

   - Use: 

     - "Apples: red/green, sweet/tart."

     - "Bananas: yellow when ripe, source of potassium."

 

4. **Chunk Large Lists**:

   - Break large lists into smaller, simpler units to enhance accessibility.

   - **Example**: 

     - Original: "Items in the store include apples, bananas, cherries, dates, eggs, flour, grapes, honey, ice cream, jam."

     - Chunked: 

       - **Fruits**: apples, bananas, cherries, grapes.

       - **Other Items**: dates, eggs, flour, honey, ice cream, jam.

 

#### Tables

 

1. **Use Stem Sentences**:

   - Provide a context-setting sentence before the table.

   - **Example**: "Table 1 shows the nutritional content of fruits."

   - Table 1: Nutritional Content of Fruits

 

   | Fruit    | Calories | Vitamins  |

   |----------|----------|-----------|

   | Apple    | 52       | C, K      |

   | Banana   | 89       | B6, C     |

 

2. **Avoid Positional References**:

   - Do not use references like "below" or "as follows." or "following"
   - Do not use any any occurrences of directional words such as "following", "follows", "preceding", "precedes", "below", "above". However, do not confuse or flag usage of the word follow (as in follow these steps).

   - **Example**: Instead of "The table below shows...", use "Table 1 shows..."

 

3. **Complete Sentences for Standalone Content**:

   - Ensure that the stem sentence and any standalone content are complete sentences.

4. **Table Structure**:

   - Organize information in a way that makes it easy to access and understand, with rows and columns clearly labeled.

   - **Example**: Use headers for each column to clarify the type of data being presented.

 

5. **Capitalization and Punctuation**:

   - Follow specific rules for capitalization and punctuation depending on the content of the table cells:

     - **Complete Sentence**: Use sentence case and end with a period.

     - **Standalone Phrase**: Use sentence case without punctuation.

     - **Phrase with Header**: Use lower case, and the final column may end with a period if it completes a sentence.

   - **Example**:

     - Complete Sentence: "The system is fully operational."

     - Standalone Phrase: "Maximum capacity"

     - Phrase with Header: "operates continuously"

 

#### Example of a Table

 

- Example Table: Product Specifications**

 

  "Table 4 details the specifications of the new smartphone model."

 

  | Feature          | Specification                   |

  |------------------|---------------------------------|

  | Display          | 6.1-inch OLED                    |

  | Battery Life     | Up to 18 hours                   |

  | Processor        | A14 Bionic chip                  |

  | Storage Options  | 64GB, 128GB, 256GB               |

 


### 4 Stem Sentences

 

1. **Provide Context**:

   - A stem sentence should introduce the list, table, or visual, providing context and helping the user understand what follows. However, do not use directional words such as follows, following, or below.
 

2. **Use Proper Punctuation**:

   - The punctuation of a stem sentence depends on its structure and what it introduces. It may end with a period, colon, or no punctuation, following English grammar rules.

   - **Example**: "Table 1 displays the supported software versions."

 

3. **Avoid Positional References**:

   - Avoid using terms like "below" or "as follows" or "following" which can become confusing if the content layout changes.

   - **Example**: Instead of "The table below shows...", use "Table 2 shows the annual sales data."

 

4. **Complete Sentences**:

   - Stem sentences should be complete sentences to ensure clarity, especially if they appear alone without immediate context.

   - **Example**: "Figure 4 illustrates the workflow of the new system."

 

5. **Parallel Construction**:

   - When introducing lists, ensure that the stem sentence and list items form a complete, parallel construction.

   - **Example**: "A good diet includes fruits, vegetables, and whole grains."

 

#### Examples of Stem Sentences

 

- **For Lists**:

  - "Consider these factors when choosing a location: proximity to transportation, availability of amenities, and safety of the neighborhood."

 

- **For Tables**:

  - "Table 3 lists the features of the latest software release."

    - Table 3: Features of the Latest Software Release

 

      | Feature       | Description                     |

      |---------------|---------------------------------|

      | Auto-update   | Automatically updates software  |

      | Dark mode     | Reduces eye strain in low light |

 


 

### Parallel Construction:

 

1. **Consistent Grammatical Structure**:

   - Use the same grammatical structure for similar ideas or elements within a sentence or list to maintain consistency and clarity.

   - **Example**: Ensure that verbs, nouns, or phrases are in the same form. 

 

2. **Balanced Clauses or Phrases**:

   - Clauses or phrases should be balanced in terms of their structure and importance, giving them equal weight.

   - **Example**: Use balanced lists or pairs to convey ideas effectively.

 

3. **Use Conjunctions Appropriately**:

   - Use conjunctions such as "and" or "or" to join parallel elements. They should be able to interchange positions without affecting the sentence's meaning.

   - **Example**: Join parallel elements with conjunctions for smooth flow.

 

4. **Improves Readability and Comprehension**:

   - Parallel construction enhances readability and helps the reader follow the logic of the content more easily.

   - **Example**: Use parallel structure to guide the reader through complex ideas.

 

#### Example of Parallel Construction

 

- **Non-Parallel**:

  - "The project aims to improve efficiency, reducing costs, and to increase customer satisfaction."

  - **Analysis**: This sentence is not parallel because "improve," "reducing," and "to increase" are not in the same form.

 

- **Parallel**:

  - "The project aims to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction."

  - **Explanation**: In the parallel version, each verb ("improve," "reduce," "increase") is in the same form, creating a balanced and clear sentence.

 

### Ordered Lists:

 

1. **Sequence Matters**:

   - Use ordered lists when the sequence or order of the items is important.

   - **Example**: Use ordered lists for instructions or steps in a process.

 

2. **Correct Sequence**:

   - Ensure that each item is in the correct sequence to convey the intended meaning or process.

   - **Example**: Steps should be logically ordered to guide the reader.

 

3. **Numbering**:

   - Number each list item to indicate the order and make it easier for the reader to follow.

   - **Example**: Use numbers (1, 2, 3,...) to denote sequence.

 

4. **Consistent Punctuation**:

   - Do not use additional grammar within the list items. Each item should be a concise statement or instruction.

   - **Example**: Avoid unnecessary punctuation like semicolons at the end of list items.

 

5. **Clear Stem Sentence**:

   - Use a stem sentence to introduce the list, ending with a colon to indicate that a list follows.

   - **Example**: Provide context with a clear introductory sentence.

 

#### Examples of Ordered Lists

 

- **Example 1: Instructions for Resetting a Password**

  - "The steps to reset your password:"

    1. Go to the login page.

    2. Click on 'Forgot Password'.

    3. Enter your registered email address.

    4. Check your email for a reset link.

    5. Follow the link to create a new password.

 

- **Example 2: Recipe for Baking a Cake**

  - "The steps to bake a cake are:"

    1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).

    2. Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl.

    3. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar.

    4. Combine the wet and dry ingredients.

    5. Pour the batter into a greased cake pan.

    6. Bake for 30-35 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean.

 

### Unordered Lists: 
An unordered list is a bulleted list that has multiple items for which the sequence does not matter. 

A stem sentence is a lead-in phrase or sentence that introduces any list that provides the user with context to the information that follows. Stem sentences help you write better lists by making the
content parallel.

Here are the two types of unordered lists along with the respective rules.

#### Type 1: Stem sentence is a phrase

- **Example of an unordered list where the stem sentence is a phrase:**
   A SAN port channel
   - is a logical interface that combines a set of Fibre Channel interfaces connected to the same Fibre
   - Channel node and operates as one link
   - supports bandwidth utilization and availability, and
   - connects to Fibre Channel core switches from Cisco ACI switches and to provides optimal bandwidth utilization and transparent failover between the uplinks of a VSAN.

- **Rules for List Items**:
   - Write each list item in lower case.
   - End all list items except the last two with no punctuation.
   - End the second-last item with ", and" or ", or". "and" denotes that all items apply. "or" denotes that the items are alternatives
   - End the last list item with a period.


#### Type 2: Stem Sentence is a complete sentence

- **Example of an unordered list where the stem sentence is a complete sentence**
   Follow these guidelines to write stem sentences for unordered lists comprising full sentences:
      - Write each list item in sentence case.
      - End each list item with a period.
      - Omit conjunctions at the end of the second-to-last list item.
      - Use a colon for a stem sentence according to the rules of English grammar. When each list item is a standalone sentence, use a colon to end the stem sentence.

- **Rules for List Items**:
   Follow these guidelines to write stem sentences for unordered lists comprising full sentences:
      - Write each list item in sentence case.
      - End each list item with a period.
      - Omit conjunctions at the end of the second-to-last list item.
      - Use a colon for a stem sentence according to the rules of English grammar. When each list item is a standalone sentence, use a colon to end the stem sentence.
         

### Item-Description Lists:

 

1. **Two-Part Structure**:

   - Each item in the list should have two parts: the item itself and its corresponding description.

   - **Example**: Clearly separate the item from its description for clarity.

 

2. **When to Use**:

   - Use an item-description list when detailing parts and their descriptions, or when items in a list have associated values or features.

   - **Example**: Ideal for glossary entries or feature lists.

 

3. **Description Formatting**:

   - If the description is a sentence fragment, start it with a lowercase letter. If it's a complete sentence, start with an uppercase letter.

   - **Example**: Ensure consistency in formatting based on the description type.

 

4. **No Positional References**:

   - Avoid using positional references like "below" or "as follows" in the stem sentence introducing the list.

   - **Example**: Use a complete sentence without relying on the document's layout.

 

5. **Period Usage**:

   - Always use a period at the end of the stem sentence.

   - **Example**: Ensure the stem sentence is a standalone complete sentence.

 

#### Examples of Item-Description Lists

 

- **Example 1: Glossary of Terms**

  - "These terms are used throughout this document."

    - **Bandwidth**: the amount of data that can be transmitted in a fixed amount of time.

    - **Throughput**: the amount of data moved successfully from one place to another in a given time period.

 

- **Example 2: Feature Descriptions of a Product**

  - "This product includes several key features."

    - **Battery Life**: Lasts up to 12 hours on a single charge.

    - **Water Resistance**: Rated IP68 for use in wet conditions.

    - **Camera**: 12 MP dual-lens system with night mode.

 

- **Example 3: System Components**

  - "The components of a system are:"

    - **CPU**: The central processing unit that executes instructions.

    - **RAM**: Memory that stores data temporarily for quick access.

    - **Hard Drive**: Storage device for permanent data retention.

 
### Positional References:

   - Do not use references like "below" or "as follows." or "following"
   - Do not use any any occurrences of directional words such as "following", "follows", "preceding", "precedes", "below", "above". However, do not confuse or flag usage of the word follow (as in follow these steps).

   - **Example**: Instead of "The table below shows...", use "Table 1 shows..."

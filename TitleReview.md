Please provide a title along with its corresponding information type in the format: "Title (Information Type)". The system will identify the information type from the round brackets and review the title based on the titling rules for that information type. For example, if you provide "Introduction to VFN (Concept)", the system will review the title according to the concept titling rules.


Review Criteria by Information Type:


Task:

Check if the title uses an imperative verb in the second person.
Ensure the title is in sentence case.
Process:

For human processes, verify if the title uses a verb gerund ("...ing") + plural noun.
For system processes, check if the title follows the format "How (items) [work]".
Ensure the title is in sentence case.
Principle:

Confirm if the title expresses the gravity first and the principle later or vice versa.
Ensure it uses the second person, imperative.
Verify if the title is in sentence case.
Concept:

Ensure the title uses the plural form of the noun if possible.
Confirm it uses the third person.
Check that additional words and phrases like "what is," "introduction," "about," "overview," or "definition of" are omitted.
Ensure it avoids words ending with "-ing."
Verify if the title is in sentence case.
Reference:

Confirm if the title describes the item and differentiates it from others.
Ensure it uses third person, active voice, present tense.
Verify the title captures the general subject of the content.
Ensure the title is in sentence case.

Example:
Input: "Introduction to VFN (Concept)"
Review Output: The title "Introduction to VFN" does not adhere to the concept titling rules because it includes the phrase "Introduction to" and does not use the plural form or third person. Consider revising it to "Virtual Function Networks".
